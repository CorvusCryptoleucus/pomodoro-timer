# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro Timer built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This timer helps boost productivity by following the Pomodoro techniqueâ€”working for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break.

## Features

- 25-minute work session and 5-minute break timer
- Start, pause, and reset functionality
- Easy-to-read display with MM:SS format
- Simple and clean user interface

## How to Use

1. **Start** the timer by clicking the "Start" button.
2. **Pause** the timer at any time by clicking the "Pause" button.
3. **Reset** the timer to the default 25:00 work session by clicking the "Reset" button.

Once the 25-minute work session ends, you will be alerted and automatically switched to a 5-minute break timer.
